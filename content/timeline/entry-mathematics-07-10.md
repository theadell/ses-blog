Course consists of tests during the year and a final exam, which
are divided 50/50 in the final score. 50% of the class failed last year.

Two parts, recap of basics and more advanced stuff coming later.

### Tools

Useful: Wolfram Alpha, Matlab

Will use Matlab in the course, can download it from FH.
ChatGPT sucks at solving math problems correctly.

### Probably important topics

- taking derivatives/antiderivatives
- partial fraction decomposition
- taylor series

### Not important

- Memorizing vocabulary
- weird antiderivative tricks

### Homework

Look at Taylor Series exercise 2.11
